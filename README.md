Sun protection: Since modest swimsuits cover more flesh, they can shield users from the sun's damaging UV rays.

Comfort: More support and coverage can be provided by modest swimsuits, which can make women feel more at ease and confident when swimming.

Modesty: A modest swimsuit might offer a method for women who like to dress modestly to enjoy swimming and other water sports without jeopardizing their personal beliefs or values.
